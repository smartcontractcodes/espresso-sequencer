# Deploying Upgradeable Smart Contracts

Upgradeable smart contracts are deployed with OpenZeppelin Defender to enable a deployment strategy that is more secure
and also uses a multi-sig Safe wallet. When deploying using openzeppelin the `defender` profile in the `foundry.toml`
file is used.

Note: One must set the environment variable `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` accordingly to use the appropriate profile in the
`foundry.toml` settings. E.g.

```bash
export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=defender
```

The profile, `profile.default` is used by default. Setting the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` variable overrides the `foundry.toml`
settings.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a multisig wallet using [Safe](https://app.safe.global/welcome/accounts) on the network you'd like to deploy
   to.
2. In OpenZeppelin Defender, create an Approval Process that requires the multisig wallet you created above.
   `Manage > Approval Processes`
3. In OpenZeppelin Defender, create a deployment environment and use the approval process created in Step 2. Be sure to
   copy the Defender secret and key, that is shown at the end of this step, into the .env file.

## Deployments

### Deploying the Fee Contract

Steps:

1. Run the Deployment Command This command requires you to go to OpenZeppelin Defender's UI to see the transaction.
   Click that transaction which opens up the Safe UI where your signers for that Safe multi-sig wallet can confirm the
   transaction. The two transactions to be confirmed are: (i) deployment of implementation contract (ii) deployment of
   proxy contract

```bash
forge clean && \
forge script contracts/script/FeeContractWithDefender.s.sol:FeeContractDefenderDeployScript --ffi --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com  --build-info true
```

2. Verify the Implementation contract on Etherscan (Use another window as step would not have completed yet)

```bash
forge verify-contract --chain-id 11155111 \
--watch --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
--compiler-version $SOLC_VERSION \
$FEE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
contracts/src/FeeContract.sol:FeeContract --watch
```

3. Inform Etherscan that it's a Proxy When the proxy is deployed, go to Etherscan. Go to Contract > Code > More Options
   and select the 'is this a proxy?' option. You should then be able to interact with the implementation contract via a
   proxy.

```

### Deploying the Light Client Contract

Read Deploying the Fee Contract for a more detailed version of this.

1. Initiate the Deployment with OpenZeppelin Defender

```bash
forge clean && \
forge script contracts/script/LightClientWithDefender.s.sol:LightClientDefenderDeployScript --ffi --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com  --build-info true
```

2. Verify the Contract

```bash
forge verify-contract --chain-id 11155111 \
--watch --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
--compiler-version $SOLC_VERSION \
$LIGHT_CLIENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
contracts/src/LightClient.sol:LightClient --watch
```

3. Inform Etherscan that it's a Proxy When the proxy is deployed, go to Etherscan. Go to Contract > Code > More Options
   and select the 'is this a proxy?' option. You should then be able to interact with the implementation contract via a
   proxy.

## Upgrades

### Upgrading the Fee Contract

Steps:

1.  Ensure that the salt has been updated in the `.env` file. The upgrade script retrieves the proxyAddress from the
    previous deployment by reading a file in the following path:
    `script/output/defenderDeployments/$CONTRACT_NAME/$CHAIN_ID/$SALT.json`. It knows the salt from a previous
    deployment by reading the `saltHistory.json` file. Run the following command:

```bash
forge clean && \
forge script contracts/script/FeeContractWithDefender.s.sol:FeeContractDefenderUpgradeScript --ffi --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com  --build-info true
```

2. This command requires you to go to OpenZeppelin Defender's UI to see the transaction. Click that transaction which
   opens up the Safe UI where your signers for that Safe multi-sig wallet can confirm the transaction.

The transactions being confirmed are: (i) the deployment of the new fee contract (ii) the execution of the
`upgradeToAndCall` method which updates the implementation contract that the proxy contract is referencing.

### Upgrading the Light Client Contract

Ensure that you update the version in the `getVersion()` method of the latest implementation contract.

Steps:

1.  Ensure that the salt has been updated in the `.env` file. The upgrade script retrieves the proxyAddress from the
    previous deployment by reading a file in the following path:
    `script/output/defenderDeployments/$CONTRACT_NAME/$CHAIN_ID/$SALT.json`. It knows the salt from a previous
    deployment by reading the `saltHistory.json` file. Run the following command:

```bash
forge clean && \
forge script contracts/script/LightClientWithDefender.s.sol:LightClientDefenderUpgradeScript --ffi --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com  --build-info true
```

2. This command requires you to go to OpenZeppelin Defender's UI to see the transaction. Click that transaction which
   opens up the Safe UI where your signers for that Safe multi-sig wallet can confirm the transaction.

The transactions being confirmed are: (i) the deployment of the new fee contract (ii) the execution of the
`upgradeToAndCall` method which updates the implementation contract that the proxy contract is referencing.

## Known Errors

1. Error Parsing ABI for contract Scenario: You ran `just gen-bindings` Example:

```bash
Error:
error parsing abi for contract '_70c760a3e059d83dbf77da7f6778fbc0': couldn't parse ABI string as either human readable (1) or JSON (2):
1. Illegal abi `{`, expected function
2. data did not match any variant of untagged enum JsonContract
error: Recipe `gen-bindings` failed on line 65 with exit code 1
```

This error occurs when build_info is set to true in the foundry.toml configuration. Ensure that this is false or the
foundry profile is set to default when running commands like `just gen-bindings`.

Solution: `export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=default`
